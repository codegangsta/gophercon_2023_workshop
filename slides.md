#### Lecture:
## Rethinking Connectivity

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## Why Rethink Connectivity?
**Multi-cloud** and **Edge** computing is driving a massive transformation

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## Limitations of Today's Technology

- **DNS/hostnames/IP** based discovery
- **Pull based** request/reply semantics
- **Perimeter based** security
- **Location-dependent** backends
- Many layers built on **HTTP 1:1** communication

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## Introducing NATS

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## Introducing NATS
NATS is an **open source**, **high performance** messaging system and **connective fabric**.

It aims to **simplify** the number of technologies you use for your services to communicate, while also **empowering** you to build systems that are **globally available**, **multi-cloud**, **multi-geo**, and **highly adaptive** to change and scale.

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
# Introducing NATS
+ Location-independent addressing
+ M:N communications
+ Push and pull based
+ Decentralized and secure multi-tenancy
+ Intelligent persistence
+ Global scale

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## NATS Architecture
+ **Server:** simple, small, easy to deploy Go binary
+ **Client:** 40+ client libraries in various languages

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## NATS Architecture
+ **Core NATS** - High performance messaging. Temporal coupling.
+ **JetStream** - Flexible, modern streaming and persistence. Temporal decoupling.

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## Core NATS
* Fire and forget message publishing
* Very fast - Scales to millions of msg/s on a single instance
* Flexible subject based addressing with wildcards
* Payload agnostic

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## Core NATS
* **Request** and **Reply**
* **Publish** and **Subscribe**
* **Fan In** and **Fan Out**
* **Load Balancing** via **Queue Groups**

---

##### Rethinking Connectivity
## Core NATS Demo

---

### Exercise #1:
## Install the NATS CLI

---

##### Install the NATS CLI
## Now it's your turn!
```bash
$ go install \
    github.com/nats-io/natscli/nats@latest

$ nats help
```

---

### Exercise #2:
## Connecting the Room Part I

---

##### Connecting the Room Part I
## Setting up a NATS context
```
$ nats context save -select demo \
    --server "nats://demo.nats.io:4222"
    
#   Server URLs: nats://demo.nats.io:4222
#         Path: ...
#   Connection: OK
```

---

##### Connecting the Room Part I
## Calling the guestbook service
```
$ nats req gophercon.guestbook ""
```

---

##### Connecting the Room Part I
## Hosting your own service
```
$ nats reply gophercon.rollcall \
    "YOUR NAME HERE" --queue ""
```

---

##### Connecting the Room Part I
## Play the queue group lottery
```
$ nats reply gophercon.lottery \
    "YOUR NAME HERE" --queue "lottery"
```

---

##### Connecting the Room Part I
## Poor-mans chat
```
$ nats sub "gophercon.chatroom.>"
```

And in another window:
```
$ nats pub gophercon.chatroom.[handle] \
    "Your Message Here"
```

### Lecture:
## NATS For Micro-service Architectures

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## What makes a good architecture?

- Resilient
- Secure
- Observable
- Extensible
- Adaptive to change

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## What NATS gives us
- Resilience
- Secure multi-tenancy
- Location transparency
- Observability
- Multi-pattern development

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## Resilience

- **Clients** self heal and reconnect to available servers automatically
- **Servers** protect themselves at all costs
- **Failover** to other Geos/Clouds is **automatic**
- **Load balancing** comes for **free**

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## Secure Multi-tenancy
- **Decentralize** authentication and authorization
- **Isolate** NATS environments via **Accounts**
- **Share** streams and services between accounts
- **Enforce** resource limits for tenants
- **Create** permissions for each service without server changes

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## Location Transparency
Location transparency is a key characteristic of service-oriented architecture.

Consumers of a service do not know a service's location until they locate it in the registry.

The lookup and dynamic binding to a service at runtime allows the service implementation to move from location to location without the client's knowledge.

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## Location Transparency
- Free **Service Discovery** via subject based addressing
- **Easily move** services between cloud providers
- **Automatically** get routed to the closest responder
- **Traffic Shaping** and **Subject mapping**

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## Observability
- **Observe traffic** in real time
- **Gather metrics** on each of your services automatically via `nats micro`
- **Filter metrics ingestion** via subjects

---

##### NATS For Micro-service Architectures
## Multi-pattern development
- Synchronous **Request** and **Reply**
- Asynchronous **Publish** and **Subscribe**
- **Streaming** with NATS JetStream
    - Key/Value and Object store
- All with multi-language support!

---

#### Exercise #3:
## Building a Go Micro-service

---

##### Building a Go MicroService
## NATS `micro` package
- Set of conventions for microservices
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Metrics and monitoring
- Metadata

---

##### Building a Go MicroService
## Start a `micro` from NATS CLI
```bash
$ nats micro serve hello \
    -H Owner="Your Name"
```

... And make a request

```bash
$ nats req hello.echo ""
```

---

##### Building a Go MicroService
## Start a new Go project
```bash
$ mkdir my_service && cd my_service
$ go mod init github.com/[ME]/my_service
$ go get github.com/nats-io/nats.go@latest
```

---

#### Exercise #4:
## Connecting the Room Part II

---

#### Lecture:
## NATS Server Topologies

---

##### NATS Server Topologies
## Global Scale and Diversity
- **Single Server** - Millions of messages per sec. ~70GiB throughput
- **Clusters and Superclusters** - Fully meshed groups of servers that can span the globe
- **Leaf Nodes** - Extend a NATS system with your own private island

---

##### NATS Server Topologies
## An Illustrated Guide

---

#### Exercise 5:
## Installing and Connecting to a NATS Server

---

#### Exercise 6:
## Leaf Nodes

---

#### Lecture:
## NATS JetStream

---

##### NATS JetStream
## What is JetStream?
JetStream is a next-gen persistence layer built on top of NATS Core that allows temporal decoupling between subscribers and publishers.

It is multi-tenant, highly configurable and globally scalable.

---

##### NATS JetStream
## What is JetStream?
- **Secure** data streams with **multiple consumer models**
- **Multiple streaming patterns** supported
- **Digital twins**/**replicated data**
- **Mux** and **Demux** data
- **Materialized views:** key/value and object stores
